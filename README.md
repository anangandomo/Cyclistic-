# Introduction
This case study is from the Data Analysts Google Certification capstone course. This case study is based on a fictional bike-sharing company called Cyclistic. Cyclistic has two types of customers: Members and Casual riders. The Casual riders consist of single-ride and full-day passes, and Members consist of people with annual memberships.
